            <h1>How did I contribute?</h1>

            <p>Developed a client-server chat system using Java socket programming using a multithreaded server to handle connections concurrently, enabling 100+ simultaneous client connections.</p>
            <p>Developed messaging features using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for socket connections and Java streams for communication.</p>
            <p>Optimised communication by implementing buffered streams and reusing socket connections, resulting in 20% reduced Input/Output (IO) operations and 20% reduced TCP handshake latency</p>
